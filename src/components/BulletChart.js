          This demonstrates a custom type which uses multiple OrdinalFrames to
          create a bullet chart. The bullet chart has multiple bar-like elements
          as well as a single line element to relay different information.
        </p>
        <p>
          A custom type function in OrdinalFrame returns a structured object for
          each element to be displayed on the frame. That object has a an "o"
          attribute that takes the name of the column, a "piece" attribute that
          holds the original data associated with the graphical object, a
          "renderElement" which is either an object with properties suitable to
          be spread onto a Mark or SVG JSX, and an "xy" which has the "x" and
          "y" value for hover annotations when pieceHoverAnnotation is turned
          on. In this way you can create a bullet chart like the one above that
          has interactive tooltips on all elements. The main reason for using
          multiple OrdinalFrames is the custom scale in each frame.
